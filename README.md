# About the project 

Project done by: 
- Sheryll Dumapal 

## Business Case 
Shark attacks pose a serious risk to surfers and swimmers, impacting tourism, local economies, and public safety. My project focuses on developing data-driven insights and potential solutions to enhance shark awareness and mitigation strategies.

## Problems  
- Lack of real-time shark detection solutions.
- Inconsistent and incomplete historical data.
- Difficulty in predicting attack-prone locations and times.

## Oppertunity 
- Use data analytics to identify attack patterns.
- Develop AI-powered shark tracking applications.
- Provide governments and businesses with actionable insights to improve public safety.

## Hypotheses
- Certain activities, such as surfing, increase the likelihood of shark encounters.
- Attacks are more frequent in the afternoon due to increased human activity.
- Some regions have a higher concentration of attacks due to environmental conditions.

## Next Steps and Implementation Plan 
- Enhance data collection and classification accuracy.
- Develop a real-time shark monitoring system.
- Collaborate with stakeholders to implement safety measures.

## Why This Matters and the Big Picture Vision 
Shark attacks not only impact individuals but also have broader economic and environmental consequences. By leveraging data-driven insights, I aim to create safer ocean environments while promoting coexistence with marine life.

# Method 
- Cleaned inconsistent and incomplete records.
- Standardized time formats and activity categories.
- Filtered data to focus on relevant timeframes.

# Functions 
- Data cleaning and preprocessing functions.
- Visualization functions for attack trends.
- Statistical analysis for hypothesis testing.

# Problems and Technical Challenges 
- Data Issues: Missing and inconsistent data made it challenging to establish patterns. I resolved this by normalizing and filling gaps using statistical methods.

- Complexity of Shark Species Classification: Many attack records lacked clear species identification, which affected accuracy. I mitigated this by categorizing them based on available descriptions.

- Timeframe Selection: Filtering relevant time periods required careful consideration to balance data accuracy and representativeness.
